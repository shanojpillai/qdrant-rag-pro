    "content": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches in natural language processing. RAG systems first retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base using semantic search, then use this information to generate more accurate and contextually appropriate responses. This approach helps reduce hallucination in large language models by grounding responses in factual information. The RAG pipeline typically consists of document ingestion, embedding generation, vector storage, retrieval, and response generation phases. Modern RAG systems often employ hybrid search strategies that combine dense vector search with sparse keyword matching for optimal retrieval performance.",

    "content": "Hybrid search combines the benefits of both semantic search (using vector embeddings) and traditional keyword search (using BM25 or TF-IDF). This approach provides better search results by capturing both semantic meaning and exact term matches. The key is to properly weight the contributions of each search method based on the query type and domain requirements. Technical queries often benefit from higher keyword weights, while conversational queries perform better with higher semantic weights. Implementation involves running both search methods in parallel and combining their scores using weighted averages or more sophisticated ranking algorithms. Modern search systems often use machine learning to automatically adjust these weights based on query characteristics.",
